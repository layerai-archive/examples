In this e-commerce example walkthrough, we will train a machine learning model to predict review scores of orders [a number between 1 and 5] based on some order and its items based features extracted from Brazilian e-commerce company OLIST's datasets. --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

## How to use

Make sure you have the latest version of Layer:
```
!pip install layer -q
```

```python
import layer

my_model = layer.get_model('layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/models/review_score_predictor_model:2.1').get_train()

df = layer.get_dataset('layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/training_data:1.2').to_pandas()

test_sample = df.drop(['review_score', 'order_id'], axis=1).sample()
predicted_review_score = my_model.predict(test_sample)
print("PREDICTED REVIEW SCORE [1-5]: ",predicted_review_score)
```
PREDICTED REVIEW SCORE [1-5]: [4.356268]

## Datasets

We will use the famous [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) to train our model. We will only use 3 of those datasets: *olist_orders_dataset.csv* & *olist_order_items_dataset.csv* & *olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv*. Please check descriptions of these datasets from its Kaggle link above.

We have created total of 9 Layer datasets in this project. Here is the list of those datasets and their little descriptions.

From the *olist_orders_dataset.csv* file, we have created 3 datasets:

*  **orders_raw_table:** This is basically identical to the csv file. It just Layer Dataset definition of the same orders raw data.

https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/orders_raw_table

* **orders_clean_table:** This is the clean version of the orders data after applying some data transformation operations on the orders_raw_table. 

https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/orders_clean_table

* **orders_based_features:** High level features extracted from the orders_clean_table.

https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/orders_based_features


From the *olist_order_items_dataset.csv* file, we have created 3 datasets:
* **items_raw_table:** This is basically identical to the csv file. It just Layer Dataset definition of the same items raw data.
 
https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/items_raw_table

* **items_clean_table:** This is the clean version of the items data after applying some data transformation operations on the items_raw_table. 

https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/items_clean_table

* **items_based_features:** High level features extracted from the items_clean_table.

https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/items_based_features


From the *olist_order_reviews_dataset.csv* file, we have created 2 datasets

* **reviews_raw_table:** This is basically identical to the csv file. It just Layer Dataset definition of the same reviews raw data.

https://app.layer.ai/layer/ecommerce_olist_order_review_score_prediction/datasets/reviews_raw_table

* **reviews_clean_table:** This dataset is created to extract target variable for the problem which is the review scores for the past orders. 


Finally, we created the training_data which merges the orders_based_features, items_based_features and reviews_clean_table. This dataset is used to train the model.

## Model

We will be training a XGBRegressor from xgboost. We will fit the training dataset we have created. You can find all the model experiments and logged data here:
