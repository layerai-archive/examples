# Comprehensive Getting Started with Layer

[![Open in Layer](https://development.layer.co/assets/badge.svg)](https://app.layer.ai/layer/my_first_project) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/layerai/examples/blob/main/comprehensive-getting-started/Layer_Comprehensive_Getting_Started.ipynb) [![Layer Examples Github](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&label)](https://github.com/layerai/examples/tree/main/comprehensive-getting-started)

Layer is an ML Metadata store where you log, display, compare and share all assets produced during a project development. Everything will be in a single place including project documentations so that it will enable DS teams to work collaboratively. 

In this project, we walk through an end-to-end example to cover most of important features of the Layer platform.

Here is a list of Layer features we have showed in this project:

- dataset and model decorators
- resources decorator
- fabric decorator
- different assertion decorators
- layer.log function
- how to add a dynamic project documentation 

## General Information

We create total of 2 datasets and 1 model in this project. The data is generated artificially by using make_regression Python function. 

## Datasets
